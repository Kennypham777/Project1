            <h1>Blackjack Rules</h1>

            <div class="rule">
                <p class="step">1. Card Values:</p>
                <p>- 2-10 = Face value.</p>
                <p>- Jack, Queen, King = 10 points.</p>
                <p>- Ace = 1 or 11 points (whichever benefits the hand).</p>

                <p class="step">2. Goal:</p> 
                <p>- Get as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting).</p>
                <p>- Beat the dealer’s hand without busting.</p>

                <p class="step">3. Initial Deal:</p> 
                <p>- You get two cards face up.</p>
                <p>- Dealer gets two cards (one face up, one face down).</p>

                <p class="step">4. Blackjack:</p> 
                <p>- If you get an Ace + 10-value card = Blackjack!</p>
                <p>- Blackjack beats all hands except the dealer's Blackjack.</p>

                <p class="step">5. Player’s Choices:</p> 
                <p>- Hit: Take another card.</p>
                <p>- Stand: Keep your current hand.</p>
                <p>- Double Down: Double your bet, take one more card, and then stand.</p>
                <p>- Split: If your first two cards are a pair, split them into two separate hands.</p>

                <p class="step">6. Dealer’s Rules:</p>
                <p>- Dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or more.</p>
                <p>- Dealer stands on 17 or higher (in some games, they hit on soft 17).</p>

                <p class="step">7. Winning:</p>
                <p>- If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win.</p>
                <p>- If the dealer busts (goes over 21), you win.</p>
                <p>- If both hands are the same, it's a tie (push).</p>

                <p class="step">8. Payouts:</p>
                <p>- Regular win = 1:1 (you win the same as your bet).</p>
                <p>- Blackjack = 3:2 payout.</p>
                <p>- Push = No win or loss (you get your bet back).</p>
